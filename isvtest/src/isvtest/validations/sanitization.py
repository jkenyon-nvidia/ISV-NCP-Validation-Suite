"""Tenant-transition data-sanitization validations (requirement SEC21/SEC22).

Three provider-agnostic checks that assert a cloud does not hand a host to a
new tenant until it has been sanitized since the previous tenancy:

- ``MemorySanitizationCheck`` (SEC21-04): host (RAM) memory is sanitized
  between tenants.
- ``GpuMemorySanitizationCheck`` (SEC21-05): GPU/SRAM memory is sanitized
  between tenants (scoped to GPU-equipped hosts).
- ``FirmwareResetCheck`` (SEC21-06 / SEC22): TPM is cleared and BIOS/UEFI is
  recommitted during tenant transitions or hardware replacement.

All three share one provider-neutral signal: a host that has served a tenant
must pass through a dedicated *sanitizing* lifecycle stage before it becomes
allocatable to a new tenant again. The check inspects the host's recorded
state ``transitions`` and fails a host that went from ``in_use`` back to
``available`` without an intervening ``sanitizing`` stage, or that is offered
to new tenants while still bound to a prior tenant. They only inspect the
provider-neutral JSON a step script emits, so any provider that maps its
host lifecycle into the documented fields can reuse them.
